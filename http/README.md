# HTTP

This HTTP package contains helper methods for configuring [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) to serve static files. These methods bind URL paths to directories and files. It also contains a small HTTP server executable, akin to Python's SimpleHTTPServer (now [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html)), but without any templates for rendering directories.
