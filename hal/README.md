# Hardware abstraction layer

This set of packages provides a common API to access different hardware facilities on different platforms. These APIs are designed to be simplistic. More functionality can be added as needed.

- [gpio](./gpio) GPIO (General Purpose IO) abstractions for working with simple pins and pin-based buses.
- [spi](./spi) SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) bus.
- [output](./output) Abstractions for printing output.
- [time](./time) Abstractions for timing and delays.
